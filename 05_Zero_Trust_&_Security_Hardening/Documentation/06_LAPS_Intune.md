# Local Administrator Password Management (LAPS) with Intune

## Overview

Local Administrator Password Management (LAPS) in Intune allows you to automatically manage and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows devices enrolled in Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune). Each device gets a unique, complex local admin password that is rotated periodically and securely stored in Azure AD.

This improves security by reducing the risk of lateral movement through shared or static local admin passwords.

### Notes

- This policy automatically manages the local administrator password on Azure AD joined or Hybrid Azure AD joined devices.
- The password is rotated automatically based on the configured interval.
- Monitor password retrieval permissions via Azure AD roles to maintain security.

## Retrieving the Local Admin Password

You can retrieve the stored local admin password for a device using PowerShell or through the Intune portal.

### Using PowerShell

Install the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation?view=graph-powershell-1.0) and run the following:

```powershell
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All"
$deviceId = "<Device Object ID>"
$password = Get-MgDeviceManagementManagedDeviceLapsActivedirectoryDevicePassword -ManagedDeviceId $deviceId
Write-Output $password
```
(Replace <Device Object ID> with the actual device ID.)


# Alerts and Monitoring for LAPS with Intune

Intune does **not provide built-in alerts** for local admin password changes or access events.

To implement alerting, integrate Intune with **Microsoft Sentinel**:

- **Create custom analytic rules** in Sentinel to detect actions related to local administrator accounts, such as:
  - Password retrieval
  - Password rotation

- Use **Logic Apps** or **Automation runbooks** to send notifications by:
  - Email
  - Microsoft Teams

### Example

Detect when a local admin password is retrieved or rotated and trigger an alert to security operations.
