# Local Administrator Password Management (LAPS) with Intune

## Overview

Local Administrator Password Management (LAPS) in Intune allows you to automatically manage and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows devices enrolled in Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune). Each device gets a unique, complex local admin password that is rotated periodically and securely stored in Azure AD.

This improves security by reducing the risk of lateral movement through shared or static local admin passwords.

## 1. Create PowerShell Script to Add Local Administrator Account

The following PowerShell script checks if the local user `LAPS_Admin` exists. If not, it creates the account, sets it to enabled, and adds it to the local Administrators group.

```powershell
$AccountName = "LAPS_Admin"

# Generate random Password
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Web
$plainPassword = [System.Web.Security.Membership]::GeneratePassword(16,3)
$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString $plainPassword -AsPlainText -Force

$user = Get-LocalUser -Name $AccountName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

if (-not $user) {
New-LocalUser -Name $AccountName -Password $Password -FullName "LAPS Managed Admin Account" -Description "Account managed by LAPS via Intune" -PasswordNeverExpires:$true -AccountNeverExpires:$true
    Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators" -Member $AccountName

    Write-Output "User '$AccountName' created and added to Administrators group."
    Write-Output "Generated password: $plainPassword"
} else {
    Write-Output "User '$AccountName' already exists."
}
```
> Note: The password set here is temporary. LAPS will rotate and manage the password automatically after deployment.

## 3.  Create and Deploy the LAPS Admin Script via Intune

1. Go to **Microsoft Intune Admin Center**  
   Navigate to **Devices** > **Scripts** > Click **+ Add**.

2. Select the platform:
   - **Platform**: Windows 10 and later

3. **Basics**  
   - **Name**: `Create_LAPS_Admin`  

4. **Script Settings**
   | Setting                                              | Value         | Notes                                      |
   |------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
   | Upload .ps1 file                                     | ‚úîÔ∏è            | Upload the `Create_LAPS_Admin.ps1` script  |
   | **Run this script using the logged on credentials**  | **No**        | Ensures script runs as SYSTEM              |
   | **Enforce script signature check**     | **No**      | Set to Yes only if the script is signed                    |
   | **Run script in 64-bit PowerShell host** | **Yes**   | Recommended for compatibility                               |

5. **Assignments**
   - Assign to the **same device group** used for your LAPS policy (e.g., `Windows 10/11 Devices`).

6. **Review + Add**
   - Confirm your settings and click **Add** to deploy the script.

![LAPS_Script_Intune](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/05_Zero_Trust_%26_Security_Hardening/Screenshots/LAPS_Scirpt_Intune.png)

üìå *Once deployed, the script will run on the targeted devices and create the `LAPS_Admin` local administrator account automatically. The LAPS policy will then manage this account‚Äôs password.*

---


## 4. Deployment and Operation on Client Devices

- Upon receiving the PowerShell script, client devices will create the `LAPS_Admin` local administrator account (if not already present).
- GO to a client machine : eg: `John Doe`

![LAPS_Admin_JD](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/05_Zero_Trust_%26_Security_Hardening/Screenshots/LAPS_Admin_JD.png)

- The LAPS policy will manage and rotate the password of this account automatically according to your configured schedule.

- The password is securely backed up to Azure AD or your specified backup directory.


## 5. Monitoring and Security

- Use Azure AD role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict and monitor who can retrieve the managed passwords.

- Regularly audit access logs for any unauthorized attempts.

- Monitor device compliance and script execution status via Intune reporting.
