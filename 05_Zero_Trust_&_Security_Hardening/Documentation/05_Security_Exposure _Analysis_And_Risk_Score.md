# 🔎 Security Exposure Analysis, Remediation & Risk Management

## 🎯 Objective

Reduce exposures reported by **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)** through actions like **ASR rules**, Defender configuration, system updates, and document any accepted residual risks.

## 📝 Introduction

Effective exposure management helps reduce attack surfaces. This section shows a **real-world fix** for a high alert from MDE’s **TVM** dashboard.

You’ll follow step-by-step remediations mapped to Microsoft security recommendations, covering both **automated defenses** (e.g., ASR rules, PUA blocking, Controlled Folder Access) and **manual risk acceptance**, aligned with business and operational needs.

This structured approach reinforces Zero Trust principles and supports frameworks such as **NIST** and **ISO/IEC 27001**.

You can run the following PowerShell script to get the list of ASR rules applied and their corresponding actions in a readable format.

### ▶️ PowerShell Script

```powershell
$ids = (Get-MpPreference).AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids
$actions = (Get-MpPreference).AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions

for ($i = 0; $i -lt $ids.Count; $i++) {
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Rule_GUID = $ids[$i]
        Action    = switch ($actions[$i]) {
            0 { "Disabled" }
            1 { "Block" }
            2 { "Audit" }
            6 { "Warn" }
            Default { "Unknown" }
        }
    }
}

### 🧰 1. Set 'Minimum Password Length' to less than 14 characters

**Risk Description:**  
The recommendation is to enforce a minimum password length of 14 or more characters. Shorter passwords increase the risk of brute force attacks and password guessing.

**Risk Acceptance:**  
"We accept the risk of using a minimum password length less than 14 characters because the current policy enforces a minimum of 12 characters.

**Justification:**  
- Implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).  
- Account lockout thresholds configured to prevent brute force attempts.  
- Regular password change policies and user education on password strength.
