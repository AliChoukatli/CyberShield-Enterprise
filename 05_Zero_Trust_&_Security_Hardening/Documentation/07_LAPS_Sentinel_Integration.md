# 1 - Enable Audit Logging for LAPS (PowerShell Script)

### üéØ Objective:
Enable key audit policies required for tracking LAPS_Admin activity‚Äîsuch as password retrieval and local login‚Äîusing Microsoft Sentinel.

### üß© Step 1 ‚Äî Create the PowerShell Script

Create a PowerShell script (`Enable_LAPS_Audit.ps1`) with the following content:

```powershell
$auditSettings = @(
    @{ Subcategory = "Credential Validation"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" },
    @{ Subcategory = "Logon"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" },
    @{ Subcategory = "Special Logon"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" },
    @{ Subcategory = "File System"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" },            
    @{ Subcategory = "Registry"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" },                
    @{ Subcategory = "Other Object Access Events"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" }, 
    @{ Subcategory = "Sensitive Privilege Use"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" }
)

foreach ($setting in $auditSettings) {
    Write-Output "Setting audit policy for subcategory: $($setting.Subcategory) (Success=$($setting.Success), Failure=$($setting.Failure))"
    AuditPol /set /subcategory:"$($setting.Subcategory)" /success:$($setting.Success) /failure:$($setting.Failure)
}
```
#### üß™ Important: Before deploying this script via Intune, it is highly recommended to test it locally on a target device to ensure it works as expected.

To test locally:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator on the test machine.
2. Navigate to the folder where the script is saved.
3. Run the script with:

```powershell
.\Enable_LAPS_Audit.ps1
```
4. Verify the audit policy changes using:

```powershell
auditpol /get /subcategory:"Credential Validation"
auditpol /get /subcategory:"Logon"
auditpol /get /subcategory:"Special Logon"
auditpol /get /subcategory:"File System"
auditpol /get /subcategory:"Registry"
auditpol /get /subcategory:"Other Object Access Events"
auditpol /get /subcategory:"Sensitive Privilege Use"
```

# 2 - Connect Required Logs to Microsoft Sentinel

## üéØ Objective

Collect and ingest the relevant Windows Security event logs related to LAPS (`LAPS_Admin`) activities into Microsoft Sentinel for real-time monitoring, alerting, and investigation.

---

## üîç Key Event IDs to Collect

| Event ID | Description                             | Relevance to LAPS Monitoring                            |
|----------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 4624     | Successful Logon                     | Detect local sign-ins using `LAPS_Admin` account       |
| 4625     | Failed Logon                        | Detect failed attempts on local admin accounts         |
| 4672     | Special Privileged Logon            | Detect elevated logons (e.g., admin or system accounts)|
| 4688     | Process Creation                    | Detect suspicious process executions related to LAPS   |
| 4703     | A user right was adjusted          | Detect privilege changes affecting LAPS account        |
| 4769     | A Kerberos service ticket was requested | Relevant if LAPS accounts use Kerberos authentication |
| 1102     | Audit log cleared                  | Detect possible log tampering                            |

### üß© Step 1 - Ensure Audit Policies Are Enabled on Target Devices

Before starting, make sure you have:

- An active **Log Analytics Workspace** connected to Microsoft Sentinel.
- Azure AD joined or hybrid-joined **Windows 10/11 endpoints**.
- **Intune** or another management solution to deploy AMA at scale.
- Appropriate roles (e.g., **Log Analytics Contributor**, **Intune Admin**, **Global Admin**).

---

### üß© Step 2 ‚Äî Create a Data Collection Rule (DCR)

1. Go to the Azure Portal: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)

2. Search for **"Data Collection Rules"**

3. Click **+ Create**

4. Fill in the basic info:  
   - **Name**: `LAPS_SecurityEvents_DCR`  
   - **Region**: Same as your Log Analytics workspace  
   - **Resource Group**: Use an existing one or create a new one  

5. Reveoew Click **Next**

---

#### ‚ûï Add Data Source

1. Go to **Collect and Deliver** > **Add data source**
2. Choose **Windows Event Logs**
3. Select:  
   Security
   - Audit success
   - Audit failure

---

### üß© Step 2 - Download the MSI Installer

- Go to the official Microsoft link:  
  [https://aka.ms/azuremonitoragentwindows64](https://aka.ms/azuremonitoragentwindows64)  
- Save the file, typically named `AzureMonitorAgentSetup.msi`

---

## 2. Install the MSI Manually

- Open PowerShell or Command Prompt as Administrator  
- Run the following command (adjust the path if needed):

```powershell
msiexec /i "C:\Path\To\AzureMonitorAgentSetup.msi" /quiet /norestart
```
This will install AMA silently without rebooting immediately.

## 3. Verify the Installation
- After installation, check the service status by running:

```powershell
Get-Service -Name AzureMonitorAgent
```
The service status should be Running.

![AMA_Running](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/05_Zero_Trust_%26_Security_Hardening/Screenshots/AMA_running.png)













### üß© Step 3 - Configure Data Collection in Microsoft Sentinel

1. Go to [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)

2. Navigate to **Devices** > **Windows** > **Configuration profiles**

3. Click **+ Create profile**:

   - **Platform**: Windows 10 and later  
   - **Profile type**: Templates > Azure Monitor Agent

4. Click **Create**

---

#### Profile Configuration

- **Name**: `AMA Deployment - LAPS Logging`

- Under **Monitoring configuration**, select:  
  - **Data Collection Rule**: choose `LAPS_SecurityEvents_DCR`

- Assign the profile to the correct **device group** (e.g., `All AAD Joined Devices`)

5. Click **Next**, then **Create**

---
---

### üß© Step 4 - Verify Logs Are Ingested in Microsoft Sentinel

After a few minutes, logs should start arriving.

1. Go to Microsoft Sentinel > your workspace
2. Click Logs (Log Analytics)
3. Run the following query:

```kusto
SecurityEvent
| where EventID in (4624, 4672, 4688)
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
| take 20
> This query helps you see recent logon and privileged activity involving the LAPS_Admin account.
```
---


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)** is the recommended agent for Windows Event forwarding, replacing older agents such as OMS Agent or MMA.  
- Integrating **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** provides richer telemetry and security signals but requires proper licensing.  
- Regular maintenance and tuning of both audit policies and Sentinel detection rules are essential to minimize false positives and maximize detection accuracy.

## 3Ô∏è -  Use Cases & Detection Rules

### ‚úÖ Case 1 ‚Äî Viewing LAPS Password via Intune

This query detects users who retrieved a local admin password through Intune:

```kusto
AuditLogs
| where ActivityDisplayName == "Read deviceLocalCredentials"
| extend DeviceName = tostring(TargetResources[0].displayName)
| extend Reader = tostring(InitiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName)
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, Reader, Result = ResultReason
```
> üîî Recommendation: Create an alert rule with Medium severity. Add a condition to alert if the Reader is not part of a privileged group like LAPS Password Readers.

### ‚úÖ Case 2 ‚Äî Manual Rotation of the Local Admin Password
This query identifies manual password resets performed from the Intune console:

```kusto
AuditLogs
| where ActivityDisplayName == "Rotate local device password"
| extend DeviceName = tostring(TargetResources[0].displayName)
| extend Initiator = tostring(InitiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName)
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, Initiator
```
> üìå This may indicate troubleshooting activity or suspicious attempts to reset the admin password.

### ‚úÖ Case 3 ‚Äî Local Sign-In using the LAPS_Admin Account
Assuming Windows Security logs are connected, the following query detects logon events from LAPS_Admin

```kusto
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4624 and Account == "LAPS_Admin"
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, Account, LogonType, IPAddress = IpAddress
```

üõ°Ô∏è Alert tip: Raise an alert if logon happens:

- From an unexpected endpoint
- During non-working hours
- Too frequently (suspicious pattern)

---

## üìä LAPS Monitoring Workbook (Recommended)

Create a custom workbook to visualize:

- Daily count of password reads
- Manual rotations
- Geolocation of sign-ins with LAPS_Admin
- Audit activity summary

üß† Hunting Query Example

```kusto
AuditLogs
| where ActivityDisplayName in ("Read deviceLocalCredentials", "Rotate local device password")
| summarize count() by ActivityDisplayName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
```
