## Method 1 - Enable Audit Logging via PowerShell Script Deployment ‚Äî *Recommended*

### üéØ Objective:
Enable key audit policies required for tracking LAPS_Admin activity‚Äîsuch as password retrieval and local login‚Äîusing Microsoft Sentinel.

### üß© Step 1 ‚Äî Create the PowerShell Script

Create a PowerShell script (`Enable_LAPS_Audit.ps1`) with the following content:

```powershell
$auditSettings = @(
    @{ Subcategory = "Credential Validation"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" },
    @{ Subcategory = "Logon"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" },
    @{ Subcategory = "Special Logon"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" },
    @{ Subcategory = "File System"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" },            
    @{ Subcategory = "Registry"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" },                
    @{ Subcategory = "Other Object Access Events"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" }, 
    @{ Subcategory = "Sensitive Privilege Use"; Success = "enable"; Failure = "enable" }
)

foreach ($setting in $auditSettings) {
    Write-Output "Setting audit policy for subcategory: $($setting.Subcategory) (Success=$($setting.Success), Failure=$($setting.Failure))"
    AuditPol /set /subcategory:"$($setting.Subcategory)" /success:$($setting.Success) /failure:$($setting.Failure)
}
```
#### üß™ Important: Before deploying this script via Intune, it is highly recommended to test it locally on a target device to ensure it works as expected.

To test locally:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator on the test machine.
2. Navigate to the folder where the script is saved.
3. Run the script with:

```powershell
.\Enable_LAPS_Audit.ps1
```
4. Verify the audit policy changes using:

```powershell
auditpol /get /subcategory:"Credential Validation"
auditpol /get /subcategory:"Logon"
auditpol /get /subcategory:"Special Logon"
auditpol /get /subcategory:"File System"
auditpol /get /subcategory:"Registry"
auditpol /get /subcategory:"Other Object Access Events"
auditpol /get /subcategory:"Sensitive Privilege Use"
```

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Values Explained:
- `1` = Success  
- `2` = Failure  
- `3` = Success + Failure

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Audit Categories Overview for LAPS Monitoring

- **Credential Validation** and **Logon**:  
  These audit categories track authentication events, including logins to local accounts such as `LAPS_Admin`.

- **Special Logon**:  
  Tracks logons with elevated privileges. This is crucial for detecting administrative or privileged account access.

- **Object Access**:  
  Monitors access to sensitive files or registry keys. Useful for auditing any modifications or accesses related to LAPS configurations.

- **Sensitive Privilege Use**:  
  Monitors the use of sensitive privileges that could allow privilege escalation or security bypass.

## 2 - Connect Required Logs to Microsoft Sentinel

## üîó Log Sources to Connect

| Log Source             | Log Name                        | Description                                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Windows Event Logs**  | Microsoft-Windows-LAPS/Operational | Core LAPS operational events: password access, set operations, and errors. |
| **Security Logs**       | Security                       | Tracks user authentication, privilege use, logon sessions (e.g., Event IDs 4624, 4672). |
| **System Logs**         | System                        | Service start/stop and Group Policy processing relevant to LAPS. |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Connect These Logs to Microsoft Sentinel

- Access to Microsoft Endpoint Manager portal: [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)
- Defined Azure AD device groups targeting Windows 10/11 devices
- Administrative permissions in Intune to create and assign device configuration profiles
- You must have **access to Microsoft Sentinel** and the relevant Log Analytics workspace.

---

### Option 1 ‚Äî Using Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)

#### Objective

Deploy the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) centrally and automatically on Windows 10/11 devices managed by Intune to enable log collection for Microsoft Sentinel.

##### 1. Sign in to Microsoft Endpoint Manager portal

- Open a browser and go to [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)
- Sign in with an account with Intune admin rights

#### 2. Create a Device Configuration Profile to deploy AMA

- From the left-hand menu, select **Devices** > **Configuration profiles**
- Click **+ Create profile**

#### 3. Configure profile settings

- Platform: **Windows 10 and later**
- Profile type: **Templates**
- Select **Endpoint Protection** (or if available, select **Azure Monitor Agent** template)

> If no dedicated AMA template exists, use **Custom** profile with OMA-URI for advanced configurations or deploy via installer script.

#### 4. Configure the profile details

- Name: `Deploy Azure Monitor Agent`
- Description: `Installs the Azure Monitor Agent for log collection`

#### 5. Assign the profile

- Choose the device groups to deploy the agent to (e.g., "All Windows 10 Devices")

#### 6. Review and create

- Review the settings and click **Create** to deploy

---

## Alternative Method: Deploy AMA using PowerShell script

If no direct profile is available, deploy AMA using a PowerShell script via Intune:

- Create a PowerShell script that installs AMA MSI silently:

```powershell
Start-Process msiexec.exe -ArgumentList '/i https://aka.ms/azuremonitoragentwindows /qn' -Wait
```

---


### Option 2 ‚Äî Using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)

1. Onboard your devices to **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**.
2. In Microsoft Sentinel, navigate to **Data Connectors**.
3. Locate and open the **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** connector.
4. Follow the integration steps to connect MDE alerts and event logs to Sentinel.
5. Leverage **Advanced Hunting** queries to analyze LAPS-related events ingested from the Security and Endpoint data.

---

## Verification & Next Steps

- After connecting logs, verify ingestion by running queries in Sentinel such as:

```kusto
Event
| where EventLog == "Microsoft-Windows-LAPS/Operational"
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
| take 10
```
---

## 3Ô∏è -  Use Cases & Detection Rules

### ‚úÖ Case 1 ‚Äî Viewing LAPS Password via Intune

This query detects users who retrieved a local admin password through Intune:

```kusto
AuditLogs
| where ActivityDisplayName == "Read deviceLocalCredentials"
| extend DeviceName = tostring(TargetResources[0].displayName)
| extend Reader = tostring(InitiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName)
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, Reader, Result = ResultReason
```
> üîî Recommendation: Create an alert rule with Medium severity. Add a condition to alert if the Reader is not part of a privileged group like LAPS Password Readers.

### ‚úÖ Case 2 ‚Äî Manual Rotation of the Local Admin Password
This query identifies manual password resets performed from the Intune console:

```kusto
AuditLogs
| where ActivityDisplayName == "Rotate local device password"
| extend DeviceName = tostring(TargetResources[0].displayName)
| extend Initiator = tostring(InitiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName)
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, Initiator
```
> üìå This may indicate troubleshooting activity or suspicious attempts to reset the admin password.

### ‚úÖ Case 3 ‚Äî Local Sign-In using the LAPS_Admin Account
Assuming Windows Security logs are connected, the following query detects logon events from LAPS_Admin

```kusto
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4624 and Account == "LAPS_Admin"
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, Account, LogonType, IPAddress = IpAddress
```

üõ°Ô∏è Alert tip: Raise an alert if logon happens:

- From an unexpected endpoint
- During non-working hours
- Too frequently (suspicious pattern)

---

## üìä LAPS Monitoring Workbook (Recommended)

Create a custom workbook to visualize:

- Daily count of password reads
- Manual rotations
- Geolocation of sign-ins with LAPS_Admin
- Audit activity summary

üß† Hunting Query Example

```kusto
AuditLogs
| where ActivityDisplayName in ("Read deviceLocalCredentials", "Rotate local device password")
| summarize count() by ActivityDisplayName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
```
