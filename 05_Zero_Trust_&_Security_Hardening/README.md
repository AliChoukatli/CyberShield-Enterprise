# Zero Trust & Security Hardening

## 🎯 Objective

This chapter dives deep into implementing **Zero Trust principles** and **system hardening techniques** across your enterprise environment. You'll learn to configure robust identity controls like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Conditional Access, apply user rights assignments, implement various security controls, analyze security exposure, and deploy Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) integrated with Microsoft Sentinel for enhanced privileged access management and monitoring.

## 📝 Introduction

In today's evolving threat landscape, adopting a **Zero Trust security model** is crucial. This chapter moves beyond foundational setups to focus on advanced hardening and proactive security measures. By implementing strong authentication, fine-grained access policies, and privileged access management, you'll significantly reduce your attack surface and improve your ability to detect and respond to threats. This holistic approach strengthens your enterprise cyber defense from the inside out.
