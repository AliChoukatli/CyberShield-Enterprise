# Zero Trust & Security Hardening

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This chapter dives deep into implementing **Zero Trust principles** and **system hardening techniques** across your enterprise environment. You'll learn to configure robust identity controls like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Conditional Access, apply user rights assignments, implement various security controls, analyze security exposure, and deploy Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) integrated with Microsoft Sentinel for enhanced privileged access management and monitoring.
