# üßπ Microsoft Office Removal Script ‚Äì Purpose & Context

## üéØ Why This Script?

Removing Microsoft Office isn't always as simple as using ‚ÄúAdd or Remove Programs.‚Äù Issues often include:
- Leftover files, services, and registry entries
- Corrupted installations that block reinstallation
- Multiple conflicting Office versions (e.g., Office 2016 + M365)
- Incomplete uninstalls via GUI

This [script](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/03_IT_Helpdesk_%26_Network_Troubleshooting/PowerShell_Scripts/msoffice-removal.ps1) resolves those problems using official Microsoft tools and advanced automation.
