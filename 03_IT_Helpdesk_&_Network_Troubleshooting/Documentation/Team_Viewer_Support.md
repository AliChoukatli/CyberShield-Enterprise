# üñ•Ô∏è Remote Support with TeamViewer

## üéØ Objective

Install, configure, and use TeamViewer to provide secure remote support from the helpdesk workstation to end-user machines, enabling troubleshooting without direct domain or VPN access.

## üìù Introduction

This section demonstrates how to deliver remote assistance using **TeamViewer** between a helpdesk workstation (`LTP-HLP01`) and an end-user machine (`LTP-EMP01`). TeamViewer is a reliable remote support tool that allows IT staff to troubleshoot systems securely over the internet, without requiring domain connectivity or VPN access.

You‚Äôll learn how to install the appropriate versions on both devices, establish a secure session, and follow security best practices for closing a session safely.

## üîö Conclusion

After completing this section:

- TeamViewer is properly installed and configured on both support and end-user machines.
- A successful remote session was initiated from `LTP-HLP01` to `LTP-EMP01`, simulating real-world helpdesk support.
- Security recommendations were followed, including safe session termination and optional password reset.

This setup is ideal for hybrid support scenarios, external users, or environments where RDP is not viable.
