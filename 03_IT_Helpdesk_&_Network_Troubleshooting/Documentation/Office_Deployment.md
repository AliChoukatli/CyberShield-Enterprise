# üì¶ Deploying Microsoft 365 with ODT and PowerShell

### üéØ Objective

Install Microsoft 365 Apps (Office 365) and Visio Pro using Office Deployment Tool (ODT) with a custom PowerShell script.

## üìù Introduction

This section guides you through the deployment of Microsoft 365 Apps (Office 365) and Visio Professional using the Office Deployment Tool (ODT) combined with a custom PowerShell script. The approach ensures a silent, customizable, and automated installation process tailored to your environment.

You will start by uninstalling any existing Office installations to avoid conflicts, then prepare and customize the ODT configuration file, and finally deploy the applications efficiently across your Windows machines.


#### Step 1 ‚Äì Uninstall Existing Office Installation (if applicable)

### Recommended Method: Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant (SaRA)
1. Run this script :
```powershell
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Admonstrator/msoffice-removal-tool/main/msoffice-removal-tool.ps1 -OutFile msoffice-removal-tool.ps1; powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass .\msoffice-removal-tool.ps1
```
2. Restart the machine after uninstallation.

#### **Step 2 ‚Äì Download and Prepare the Office Deployment Tool (ODT)**

1. Download ODT from Microsoft:
   [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117)

2. Extract the content to:  
   `C:\ODT`

3. This folder should contain:
   
        C:\ODT
        ‚îÇ setup.exe
        ‚îÇ config.xml
---

#### **Step 3 ‚Äì Customize `config.xml`**

Create or edit `C:\ODT\config.xml` with the following content:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Configuration>
    <Add OfficeClientEdition="64" Channel="Current">
        <Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail">
            <Language ID="en-us"/>
        </Product>
        <Product ID="VisioProRetail">
            <Language ID="en-us"/>
        </Product>
    </Add>
    <Updates Enabled="TRUE" Channel="Current" />
    <Display Level="None" AcceptEULA="TRUE" />
    <Property Name="AUTOACTIVATE" Value="1" />
</Configuration>
```

#### **Step 4 ‚Äì Create the PowerShell Script**
- Create a new script file: C:\Scripts\DeployOffice365.ps1
```powershell
# DeployOffice365.ps1
$OfficeDeploymentPath = "C:\ODT"
$SetupFilePath = "$OfficeDeploymentPath\setup.exe"
$ConfigFilePath = "$OfficeDeploymentPath\config.xml"

# Temporarily allow script execution
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force

# Start the Office deployment
Start-Process -FilePath $SetupFilePath -ArgumentList "/configure $ConfigFilePath" -Wait
```

#### **Step 5 ‚Äì Run the Script**
- Open PowerShell as Administrator

- Run the script:
```powershell
cd C:\Scripts
.\DeployOffice365.ps1
```
You should see Office 365 begin installing in the background.

- If setup.exe opens a blank CMD and does nothing, Office is likely already installed.
- If Office is partially or already installed, the ODT setup may silently fail.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

By following this deployment process, you ensure a clean and standardized installation of Microsoft 365 Apps and Visio Pro across your environment. Using the Office Deployment Tool with PowerShell automation allows for repeatable, silent deployments that reduce manual intervention and potential errors.

This method streamlines software management in enterprise environments and lays the foundation for consistent application updates and licensing activation.
