# 06_Threat_Detection_&_Simulation

## üéØ Objective

This chapter focuses on establishing robust threat detection capabilities within your enterprise by deploying and configuring **Microsoft Sentinel**, a cloud-native Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. You'll learn how to set up the Sentinel architecture, connect data sources, and create custom analytics rules to identify suspicious activities and potential threats.

## üìù Introduction

Effective cybersecurity extends beyond prevention to include proactive detection and rapid response. This chapter provides the essential steps to build a powerful **Security Operations Center (SOC)** foundation using Microsoft Sentinel. By centralizing logs, leveraging intelligent analytics, and crafting custom detection logic, you'll significantly enhance your ability to spot anomalies and respond to incidents before they escalate, reinforcing your overall cyber defense strategy.
