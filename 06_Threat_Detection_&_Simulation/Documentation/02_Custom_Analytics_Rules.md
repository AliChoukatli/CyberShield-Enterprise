### 📄 KQL Query

```kusto
let timeRange = 1h;
let failedThreshold = 5;
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(timeRange)
| where ResultType == 50074 or ResultType == 50076 or ResultType == 50053 // Failed login codes
| summarize FailedCount = count() by UserPrincipalName, bin(TimeGenerated, 10m)
| where FailedCount >= failedThreshold
| join kind=inner (
    SigninLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(timeRange)
    | where ResultType == 0 // Successful login
    | project SuccessTime = TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName
) on UserPrincipalName
| where SuccessTime > TimeGenerated
| project UserPrincipalName, FailedCount, TimeGenerated, SuccessTime
