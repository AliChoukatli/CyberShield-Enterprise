## 💥 Malware Infection

**Objective:** Detect and contain malware to prevent lateral movement.

### 🔹 Detection Sources:
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alerts
- Sentinel alerts on suspicious process execution or file hashes

### 🔹 Actions:

- Retrieve suspicious file hash and scan across environment
- Run full antivirus scan
- Collect forensic data (memory dump, event logs)
- Block associated hash/IP in Microsoft Defender / Firewall

---

## 🔐 Unauthorized Access

**Objective:** Identify and stop compromised accounts or privilege misuse.

### 🔹 Detection Sources:
- Impossible travel / unusual location rule in Sentinel
- Audit logs showing privilege escalation

### 🔹 Actions:
- Disable user account
- Reset password + enforce MFA
- Review login history and access logs
- Conduct impact analysis on accessed data/resources
- Review user role and access rights

---

## 📤 Data Exfiltration

**Objective:** Prevent unauthorized sensitive data transfer.

### 🔹 Detection Sources:
- Sentinel alerts: large outbound traffic or use of unsanctioned apps
- Microsoft Purview DLP alerts

### 🔹 Actions:
- Isolate endpoint or block outbound traffic
- Investigate data transferred (size/type/target)
- Retrieve browser and application history
- Escalate to legal and compliance if PII is involved

---

## 🚫 Phishing Attempt

**Objective:** Stop email-based social engineering attacks.

### 🔹 Detection Sources:

### 🔹 Actions:
- Retrieve and analyze the email header and link
- Quarantine the email using Microsoft 365 Defender
- Search and purge similar messages from mailboxes
- Check clicked links or credential reuse
- Educate user & test awareness via simulation

---

## 🧑‍💻 Insider Threat

**Objective:** Detect and respond to malicious internal behavior.

### 🔹 Detection Sources:
- Sentinel behavioral rules (e.g. data copied to USB)
- Access anomalies (after-hours access, large downloads)

### 🔹 Actions:
- Review user activities over 30 days
- Monitor real-time behavior with live response tools
- Alert HR and legal teams
- If confirmed, disable account and recover data

### 🔹 Actions:
- Attempt remote wipe via Intune
- Block device from accessing corporate resources
- Revoke session tokens and certificates
- File police report (if needed)
- Document serial/device ID

---

## 🛠️ Ransomware Attack

**Objective:** Stop encryption, identify ransomware family, recover data.

### 🔹 Detection Sources:
- Defender alerts for mass file renaming/encryption
- User reports of ransom note or file changes

### 🔹 Actions:
- Immediately isolate device
- Identify ransomware type and IOCs
- Check backups and initiate recovery
- Notify security and legal teams
- Preserve disk image for law enforcement
