![PUA_Req](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/04_Zero%20Trust%20%26%20Security%20Hardening/Screenshots/PUA_Req.png)

üîç **Description:** 
Enables Microsoft Defender Antivirus to detect and block **Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs)**. These may include:
- Adware
- Crypto mining tools

üîç **Justification:**
Blocking PUAs strengthens endpoint security by:

- Preventing installation of apps that may degrade system performance or be used as vectors in larger attacks

‚úÖ **Remediation Method** ‚Äì PowerShell Script

PUA protection was enabled in **Block Mode** using the following script, executed on target systems:

```powershell
Set-MpPreference -PUAProtection 1
```
1 = Enable in Block Mode
(0 = Disable, 2 = Audit Mode)

To confirm the setting:

```powershell
Get-mpPreference | ft PUAProtection
```

### üß∞ Block Credential Stealing from LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem)

![lsaas_Req](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/04_Zero%20Trust%20%26%20Security%20Hardening/Screenshots/lsass_Req.png)

- üîç **Description** : This prevent credential theft by blocking unauthorized access to the LSASS.
- üîç **Purpose:** Prevent malware from dumping credentials from `lsass.exe` using tools like Mimikatz.
- üîç **Applicable when:** You can't enable **LSA Protection** or **Credential Guard** on all devices due to compatibility issues.
- üîç **Default Behavior:** Enabled in **Block Mode**.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This rule does **not** support **Warn Mode**.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If **LSA protection** is already enabled, this rule is **not applicable** and does not provide extra protection.

---

‚úÖ **Remediation**

- To enable this rule in **Block Mode**, add the following registry key and value: 

```reg
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Windows Defender Exploit Guard\ASR\Rules
```
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If the path doesn't exist, manually create each subkey:
Windows Defender Exploit Guard > ASR > Rules

- Add the following **String Value** inside the `Rules` key:

| Name (String)                                      | Type           | Value  |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------|
| `9E6C4E1F-7D60-472F-BA1A-A39EF669E4B2`             | `String Value` | `"1"`  |

Before enabling Network Protection, ensure the following are active:

- Microsoft Defender Antivirus running  
- Real-time protection enabled  
- Cloud-delivered protection enabled

üîç **Description:**  
Network Protection helps protect devices by blocking connections to potentially harmful domains and IPs, using Microsoft Defender SmartScreen.

üîç **Justification:**  
Prevents users from accessing known malicious websites, reducing exposure to drive-by attacks or social engineering.

‚úÖ **Remediation**

- To enable this rule in **Block Mode**, add the following registry key and value :

```reg
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Windows Defender Exploit Guard\Network Protection
```

> If the path does not exist, you must **manually create the `Network Protection` key and the value**.



| Name                     | Type      | Value |
|--------------------------|-----------|-------|
| `EnableNetworkProtection` | `REG_DWORD` | `1`   |

- `1` = Enable Network Protection in Block Mode

### üß∞ Block Untrusted and Unsigned Processes from USB Devices - GPO Method

This guide explains how to enable the Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rule that blocks untrusted and unsigned processes from running from USB devices by setting the corresponding registry key via Group Policy Object (GPO).

## Steps to configure via GPO

1. Open the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)** on a domain controller or management workstation.

2. Create a new GPO or edit an existing one linked to the target OU(s) or domain.

3. Navigate to:  
   `Computer Configuration` > `Preferences` > `Windows Settings` > `Registry`

4. Right-click **Registry**, select **New** > **Registry Item**.

5. Configure the new registry item as follows:

   - **Action:** Update  
   - **Hive:** HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  
   - **Key Path:** `SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Windows Defender Exploit Guard\ASR\Rules`  
   - **Value name:** `b2b3f03d-6a65-4f7b-a9c7-1c7ef74a9ba4`
   - **Value type:** `REG_SZ`  
   - **Value data:** `1` (`"1"` enables the rule in **Block mode**)

![USB_GPO](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/04_Zero%20Trust%20%26%20Security%20Hardening/Screenshots/USB_GPO.png)

6. Click **OK** to save.

7. Close the Group Policy Editor and ensure the GPO is linked correctly.

8. On target machines, run `gpupdate /force` or wait for policy refresh.

## ‚úÖ How to Verify if ASR Rules Are Applied

This guide explains how to check whether **Microsoft Defender Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules** are active on a system, and to display each rule along with its configured action (`Block`, `Audit`, `Warn`, or `Disabled`).

You can run the following PowerShell script to get the list of ASR rules applied and their corresponding actions in a readable format.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è PowerShell Script

```powershell
$ids = (Get-MpPreference).AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids
$actions = (Get-MpPreference).AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions

for ($i = 0; $i -lt $ids.Count; $i++) {
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Rule_GUID = $ids[$i]
        Action    = switch ($actions[$i]) {
            0 { "Disabled" }
            1 { "Block" }
            2 { "Audit" }
            6 { "Warn" }
            Default { "Unknown" }
        }
    }
}

```

## üü° Accepted Risks

| Control                                                  | Risk Level | Impact           | Justification                                                                                             | Decision  |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Set 'Minimum Password Length' to less than 14 characters | Low        | Low              | Current policy requires 12 characters for compatibility; MFA and lockout mitigate risk.                   | Accepted 
| Disable 'Autoplay' for all drives                        | Low        | Low              | Modern Windows restrict autoplay by default; full disable may impact user experience with trusted devices. | Accepted  |
| Disable Defender Firewall notifications                  | Low        | Low              | Notifications off reduces user noise; monitoring remains via logs and centralized tools.                   | Accepted  |


### 1. Set 'Minimum Password Length' to less than 14 characters

**Risk Description:**  
The recommendation is to enforce a minimum password length of 14 or more characters. Shorter passwords increase the risk of brute force attacks and password guessing.

**Risk Acceptance:**  
"We accept the risk of using a minimum password length less than 14 characters because the current policy enforces a minimum of 12 characters.

**Justification:**  
- Implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).  
- Account lockout thresholds configured to prevent brute force attempts.  
- Regular password change policies and user education on password strength.
