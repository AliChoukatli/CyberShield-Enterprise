# üîí Priority Remediations ‚Äì Security Recommendations

Below is a list of high-priority remediation actions to apply immediately in order to reduce the organization's attack surface and strengthen endpoint security posture.

---

### ‚úÖ Turn on PUA Protection in Block Mode

**Description:**  
Blocks Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs) that may contain adware, mining tools, bundlers, or software that introduces security risks.

**Justification:**  
Helps prevent low-trust applications from compromising system integrity.

---

### ‚úÖ Update Microsoft Windows 11 (OS and Built-in Applications)

**Description:**  
Ensure all Windows 11 system components and built-in apps are up-to-date.

**Justification:**  
Regular OS updates patch critical vulnerabilities and mitigate exploitation risks.


| Field                | Value                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|                       
| **Target**           |  LTP-HLP01                                |
| **Due Date**         | June 6, 2025                              |
| **Priority**         | High                                      |      

![Req_win11_update](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/04_Zero%20Trust%20%26%20Security%20Hardening/Screenshots/Req_Win11update.png)

---

---

### ‚úÖ Update Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) to Version 137.0.3296.62

**Description:**  
Update the Microsoft Edge browser to the latest stable version.

**Justification:**  
Web browsers are prime targets for exploits; updates fix known vulnerabilities and improve resilience.

---

### ‚úÖ Block Credential Stealing from LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem)

**Description:**  
Enable ASR rule to block credential dumping attempts on `lsass.exe`.

**Justification:**  
Protects against techniques used in credential theft attacks (e.g., Mimikatz) that enable lateral movement or privilege escalation.

| Field                | Value                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Target**           | LTP-HLP01                                 |
| **Due Date**         | June 6, 2025                              |
| **Priority**         | High                                      |      

---

### ‚úÖ Enable Network Protection

**Description:**  
Enforce Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to block access to dangerous domains and phishing infrastructure.

**Justification:**  
Prevents users from accessing known malicious websites, reducing exposure to drive-by attacks or social engineering.


| Field                | Value                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Target**           | LTP-HLP01                                 |
| **Due Date**         | June 6, 2025                              |
| **Priority**         | High                                      |      

---

### ‚úÖ Set Controlled Folder Access to Enabled (or Audit Mode)

**Description:**  
Enable ransomware protection by locking critical folders against unauthorized access.

**Justification:**  
Defends against ransomware attempting to encrypt sensitive user files.

---

### ‚úÖ Block Executable Content from Email Client and Webmail

**Description:**  
Prevent direct execution of embedded content or malicious attachments received via email.

**Justification:**  
Email is a common initial attack vector. This control reduces phishing and malware payload delivery.


| Field                | Value                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Target**           | LTP-HLP01                                 |
| **Due Date**         | June 6, 2025                              |
| **Priority**         | High                                      |      

---

### ‚úÖ Block Untrusted and Unsigned Processes from USB Devices

**Description:**  
Block unknown or unsigned executables that attempt to run from USB storage.

**Justification:**  
Mitigates risks related to USB-borne malware and unauthorized software execution.

---

> üõ°Ô∏è Apply these configurations via Intune, GPO, or PowerShell to harden your environment against common threats. Document remediation steps and monitor Defender recommendations regularly.


---


## üü° 2. Risk Accepted ‚Äì Digitally Sign Communications Policy

Another vulnerability was handled by accepting the risk, rather than applying the configuration immediately.

| Policy | Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Action** | Risk accepted |
| **Justification** | In a lab setup, this policy is not enforced to allow compatibility testing with legacy services. In a production environment, this setting would typically be enabled via Group Policy or Intune baseline. |
| **Status** | Documented and marked as accepted risk in Defender portal |

This demonstrates the ability to assess risk pragmatically and document security decisions for audit purposes.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Action Type | Item | Result |
|-------------|------|--------|
| Remediation | Windows 11 Update | ‚ùå Failed (Lab limitation) |
| Risk Accepted | Digitally sign communications | ‚úÖ Documented justification |

In a real-world enterprise, both items would be tracked and managed as part of a broader vulnerability management program.
