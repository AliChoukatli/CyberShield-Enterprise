# 04_AzureAD_Sync_&_Endpoint_Security

## üéØ Objective

This chapter focuses on integrating on-premises Active Directory with Azure AD, managing devices with Microsoft Intune, and deploying key endpoint security features like Microsoft Defender Antivirus, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), Microsoft Defender Firewall, and BitLocker encryption. The goal is to establish a robust and consistent security posture for all managed devices, whether they are cloud-managed or hybrid-joined.

## üìù Introduction

As organizations transition to hybrid and cloud-native environments, unifying device management and security becomes critical. This chapter details the process of extending your identity infrastructure to the cloud with Hybrid Azure AD Join, leveraging Intune for comprehensive device enrollment, and implementing Microsoft's advanced endpoint protection suite. These steps are fundamental to a modern Zero Trust security model, ensuring that devices are compliant, protected, and continuously monitored.
