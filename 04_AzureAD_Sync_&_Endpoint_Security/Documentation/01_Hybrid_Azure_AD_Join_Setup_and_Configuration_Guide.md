# üåê Hybrid Azure AD Join ‚Äì Enable Device Sync & Registration

## üéØ Objective

This phase enables you to:

1. Hybrid join your on-premises devices to Azure AD  
2. Manage Windows devices using Microsoft Intune  
3. Apply security and compliance policies  

---

## üìù Introduction

In this section, you‚Äôll learn how to **hybrid join your on-premises Windows devices to Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD). This integration allows you to bridge your local Active Directory with the cloud, enabling centralized management via **Microsoft Intune**, enforcing **security policies**, and preparing for **modern endpoint management**.

You will walk through the **entire process**, including Azure AD Connect setup, synchronization, GPO configuration, and validation through Microsoft Entra. This ensures your devices are properly hybrid joined and ready for compliance and endpoint protection in a hybrid environment.

---

## üß∞ Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure the following:

- A Microsoft 365 account with a license including Intune (e.g., Business Premium)
- On-premises Active Directory domain (e.g., `corp.aclab.tech`)
- Azure AD tenant linked to your domain (e.g., `corp.aclab.tech.onmicrosoft.com`)
- Azure AD Connect installed and configured

---

## üß≠ **Steps**

### üöÄ **A. Verify On-Prem Domain Join**

1. Run the following command on client machines to verify the on-premises domain join status:

```powershell
whoami /fqdn
systeminfo | findstr /i "domain"
```

---

### üöÄ **B. Download and Install Azure AD Connect**

1. **Download Azure AD Connect** from the [official Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47594)
2. Launch the installer and proceed through the wizard.

---

### üöÄ **C. Azure AD Connect Configuration (Custom)**

1. Open **Azure AD Connect** > Click **"Configure"**.
2. Choose **"Customize"**.
3. Select **Password Hash Synchronization**  
   ‚úÖ *Recommended for simplicity and security*.

---

### üöÄ **D. Sign In**

1. Sign in with your **Azure AD Global Admin** credentials:  
   *(e.g., admin@corp.aclab.tech)*.

---

### üöÄ **E. Create a Sync Account**

Create a dedicated sync account used by Azure AD Connect to synchronize data between on-premises AD and Azure AD:

`corp.aclab.tech\syncadmin`

- Requires permissions to read/write directory data.
- Temporarily add to Domain Admins and Administrators during setup.
- Remove elevated privileges immediately after setup.
- Optionally place in a restricted group (e.g., Azure-AD-Connect) for better management.

This dedicated account improves security and allows better auditing of sync operations.

---

### üöÄ **F. Link Directories**

1. Link your directories:
   - Select **"Use Existing Account"** to connect to your on-premises AD forest.
   - Enter the sync account credentials.

2. Once directory validation is complete, click **Next**.

---

### üöÄ **G. Enable Password Writeback and Group Writeback**

1. Enable **Password Writeback** and **Group Writeback**:
   - *Recommended to enable these features for hybrid identity management*.

üìÅ Recommended OU Structure:
```sql
corp.aclab.tech/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AzureAD-Groups/
```
![Groupe-writeback](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/04_AzureAD_Sync_%26_Endpoint_Security/Screenshots/Groups-Writeback.png)

---

### üöÄ **H. Enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for Seamless Login Experience**

1. Enable **Single Sign-On (SSO)** for a seamless login experience.

   üí° *Only Domain Admin privileges are required for configuring SSO delegation*.

---

### üöÄ **I. Start the Installation and Synchronization Process**

1. After reviewing the settings, click **Install** to begin synchronization.
2. Once complete, run the following PowerShell command to force a delta sync:

   ```powershell
   Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
   ```

---

### üöÄ **J. Configure Hybrid Azure AD Join (Windows + Azure AD Connect)**
1. Launch AzureAD Connect (Entra Connect Sync) and select Configure Device Options.
2. Choose Configure Hybrid Microsoft Entra ID Join.

![Hybrid_Join](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/04_AzureAD_Sync_%26_Endpoint_Security/Screenshots/Hybrid_Join.png)

3. Add your domain (e.g., corp.aclab.tech) and sign in with a Global Administrator account.

4. Apply the configuration to enable automatic device registration in Azure AD.

---

### üöÄ **K. Configure Hybrid Azure AD Join with Auto Device Registration GPO**

1. Open the **Group Policy Management Console** (`gpmc.msc`).

2. Locate and **edit your existing ‚ÄúAuto Device Registration‚Äù GPO** or create a new one if it doesn't exist yet, linked to the OU containing your target machines (e.g., `Devices`).

---

#### **K.1 - Enable Automatic Device Registration**

- Navigate to:  
  `Computer Configuration` ‚Üí `Administrative Templates` ‚Üí `Windows Components` ‚Üí `Device Registration`

- Double-click **Register domain-joined computers as devices** and set it to **Enabled**.

---

#### **K.2 - Add Scheduled Task to Force Hybrid Azure AD Join**

- Navigate to:  
  `Computer Configuration` ‚Üí `Preferences` ‚Üí `Control Panel Settings` ‚Üí **Scheduled Tasks**

- Right-click ‚Üí **New** ‚Üí **Scheduled Task (Windows Vista and later)**

- Configure the scheduled task as follows:

| Field                       | Value                 |

---

#### **K.3 - Apply and Validate**

## üöÄ **L. Entra ID ‚Äì Device Verification**

Once the Hybrid Azure AD Join configuration and device registration GPO are applied, you should verify that your domain-joined devices are correctly registered in Microsoft Entra ID.

### Important Note on Device Ownership

In the **Devices** list, the **Owner** field may display **None** for hybrid Azure AD joined devices. This is normal because:

- Hybrid joined devices are automatically registered without an explicit owner assigned.
- Assigning an owner manually is optional and not required for device management or compliance enforcement.

### How to Verify Device Registration

1. Access the [Microsoft Entra Admin Center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
2. Navigate to:  
Identity ‚Üí Devices ‚Üí All devices
3. Locate your devices and verify the following:
- **Join Type**: `Microsoft Entra Hybrid Joined`

![Entra Devices List](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/04_AzureAD_Sync_%26_Endpoint_Security/Screenshots/Entra-Devices.png)

This confirms your devices are successfully registered and managed via Microsoft Entra ID.

## üîö Conclusion

After completing this section, you will have:

- Successfully configured **Azure AD Connect** with proper sync and security options.
- Enabled **Hybrid Azure AD Join** to register domain-joined devices into Entra ID.
- Applied the correct **GPO and scheduled task** to trigger auto device registration.
- Verified device status using `dsregcmd /status` and through the **Microsoft Entra Admin Center**.

This setup forms the **foundation for cloud-based device management** using Microsoft Intune, allowing you to enforce compliance, apply security baselines, and enable conditional access policies across your hybrid environment.
