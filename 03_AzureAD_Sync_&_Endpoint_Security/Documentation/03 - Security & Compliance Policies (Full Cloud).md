This project implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using multiple modern methods:

1. **Microsoft Authenticator App**  
   Used for push notifications and one-time passcodes (OTP) as a second factor for secure login.

2. **Temporary Access Pass (TAP) ‚Äì Recommended Settings**

3. **FIDO2 Security Keys**  
   Although not used in this project setup, physical FIDO2 security keys (e.g., YubiKey USB devices) can also be registered and used for authentication in Microsoft Entra ID (Previously AzureAD).  
   These hardware keys provide a high level of security and are commonly used in enterprise environments.

4. **Windows Hello**  
   Provides a passwordless experience by leveraging built-in biometric sensors (face or fingerprint) and PIN on Windows devices.  
   Windows Hello uses the **FIDO2 protocol** to secure authentication without the need for passwords.

> **Note:**  
> This setup demonstrates a passwordless and strong MFA implementation using Microsoft Authenticator and Windows Hello, both of which support the FIDO2 standard.  
> For full hardware-based passwordless authentication, organizations typically deploy physical FIDO2 keys like YubiKey.

| **Allow use of Microsoft Authenticator OTP**       | ‚úÖ Yes                  | Allows use of TOTP codes from the app in addition to push notifications                      |
| **Require number matching for push notifications** | ‚úÖ Enabled (mandatory)   | Prevents MFA fatigue attacks by requiring users to enter the number shown on the screen      |
| **Show application name in notifications**         | ‚òÅÔ∏è Microsoft-managed     | App name will be shown in push/passwordless notifications when rolled out by Microsoft       |
| **Show geographic location in notifications**      | ‚òÅÔ∏è Microsoft-managed     | Location info is shown to help users detect suspicious logins                                |
| **Authenticator on companion apps**                | ‚òÅÔ∏è Microsoft-managed     | Controls the use of Authenticator on devices like Apple Watch or other paired apps           |

## ‚úÖ B. Temporary Access Pass (TAP) ‚Äì Recommended Settings

| Setting                   | Recommended Value  | Description                                                                                   |
