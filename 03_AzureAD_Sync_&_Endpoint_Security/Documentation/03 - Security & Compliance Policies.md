# 🔴 Conditional Access Policies – Recommended Settings

Conditional Access (CA) in Microsoft Entra ID enables IT admins to enforce policies that restrict or allow access to cloud resources based on conditions such as device state, user risk, and app types. These policies implement Zero Trust principles and are critical to securing identity infrastructure.

---

## ✅ 1. Block Legacy Authentication

**Purpose:** Prevent the use of outdated and insecure authentication protocols such as IMAP, POP3, SMTP AUTH, and MAPI that do not support modern security features like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

> 📌 **Note:** Microsoft no longer provides a dedicated "Legacy Authentication" setting under Authentication Methods in Entra ID. You must now block legacy authentication using Exchange Online settings and Conditional Access alternatives.

---

### 🔒 Option A — Disable Legacy Protocols via Exchange Online (Recommended)

Modern security best practices recommend disabling legacy authentication protocols such as POP, IMAP, MAPI, ActiveSync, and SMTP basic auth, which do not support modern authentication (MFA, Conditional Access, etc.).
Before running the commands, make sure you:

1. Have the **Exchange Online Management Module (EXO V2)** installed.
2. Are connected to Exchange Online PowerShell with appropriate permissions.

#### 🔹 To connect, open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName your_admin@domain.com
```
> Replace your_admin@domain.com with your actual admin account.

#### 🔹 Disable Legacy Protocols for a Single Mailbox
Use this command to disable legacy protocols on one specific user:
```powershell
Set-CASMailbox user@domain.com `
  -PopEnabled $false `
  -ImapEnabled $false `
  -MAPIEnabled $false `
  -ActiveSyncEnabled $false `
  -SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled $true
```
> Replace user@domain.com with the actual user's email.

#### 🔹Disable Legacy Protocols for All Mailboxes
Apply the same settings to all users in the organization:
```powershell
Get-CASMailbox -ResultSize Unlimited | Set-CASMailbox `
  -PopEnabled $false `
  -ImapEnabled $false `
  -MAPIEnabled $false `
  -ActiveSyncEnabled $false `
  -SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled $true
```
✅ If no errors are shown, the command has run successfully.

#### 🔹 Verify Status
Run the following to confirm that the protocols are disabled:

```powershell
Get-CASMailbox -ResultSize Unlimited | Select Name, UserPrincipalName, PopEnabled, ImapEnabled, MAPIEnabled, ActiveSyncEnabled, SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled
```
