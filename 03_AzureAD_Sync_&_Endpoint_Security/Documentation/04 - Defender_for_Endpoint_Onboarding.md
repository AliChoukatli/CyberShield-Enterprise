# ðŸ”¹Defender for Endpoint Onboarding.

-> To enable full integration between your Windows devices and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), each device must be properly onboarded. Below are two common methods: **Local Script** and **Group Policy (GPO)**.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Method 1: Onboarding via Local Script (Full Cloud)

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal:  [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)

2. Navigate to:  
   `Settings` â†’ `Endpoints` â†’ `Onboarding`

3. Connectivity type : Standard 

4. Select the device type:  
   âž¤ *Windows 10 and 11*

5. Under **Deployment method**, choose:  
   âž¤ *Local Script*

6. Click **Download package** to get a `.zip` file containing the onboarding script.

7. On the target machine:
   - Extract the `.zip` file.
   - Open **PowerShell as Administrator**.
   - Run the onboarding script:

   ```cmd
   WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingScript.cmd
   ```

### ðŸŸ¢  Method 2: Onboarding via Group Policy (GPO) (Hybride / On-premises)

This method is recommended for organizations managing domain-joined Windows devices via Group Policy.


### ðŸ“¦ Step 1 â€“ Download the Onboarding Package

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal: [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)
2. Navigate to: **Settings â†’ Endpoints â†’ Onboarding**
3. Platform: **Windows 10 and 11**
4. Deployment Method: **Group Policy**
5. Click **Download package**

This will download a `.zip` file containing:

- `WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingScript.cmd`
- `WindowsDefenderATPOnboarding.admx`
- `WindowsDefenderATPOnboarding.adml`

---

### ðŸ“¦ Step 2 â€“ Prepare the Files

1. Extract the `.zip` package
2. Locate the following files inside the extracted folder:  
   - `WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingScript.cmd` (the onboarding script)  
   - `WindowsDefenderATPOnboarding.admx` (administrative template)  
   - `WindowsDefenderATPOnboarding.adml` (language file for the ADMX)
   
--- 
## ðŸ“¦ Step 3 â€“ Create a network shared folder for onboarding files

1. On your Domain Controller (DC) or a file server, create a folder, e.g., `C:\Onboarding`.  
2. Copy the following files into this folder:  
   - `WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingScript.cmd`   
3. Share this folder over the network with read permissions for the computers and users that will apply the GPO.  
   - Example share path: `\\DC1\Onboarding`  
4. Make sure the shared folder is accessible by target devices.

## ðŸ“¦ Step 4 â€“ Add the onboarding ADMX template to Group Policy

1. Open **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)** by running `gpmc.msc` on the DC.  
2. If you want to add the template to the Central Store:  
   - Copy the `.admx` file to `\\<domain>\SYSVOL\<domain>\Policies\PolicyDefinitions\`  
   - Copy the `.adml` file to the corresponding language folder, e.g., `en-US`  
3. If you don't use a Central Store, add the template locally in GPMC:  
   - In GPMC, right-click **Administrative Templates** under a GPO â†’ **Add/Remove Templates...**  
   - Click **Add**, then select the `WindowsDefenderATPOnboarding.admx` file.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Step 5 â€“ Configure the onboarding policy in GPO

1. Edit or create a GPO that targets the devices you want to onboard.  
2. Navigate to:  
   `Computer Configuration â†’ Administrative Templates â†’ Windows Components â†’ Windows Defender Antivirus â†’ Microsoft Defender for Endpoint`  
3. Open the policy **Specify onboarding script** (or similar name).  
4. Set the policy to **Enabled**.  
5. In the script path field, enter the UNC path to the onboarding script:  

7. **Apply the Group Policy:**
   - On target machines, run the following command to force policy update:

   ```cmd
   gpupdate /force
   ```
## ðŸ“¦ Step 6 - Verify onboarding success:

   - On client devices, use PowerShell to confirm:
  ```powershell
   Get-SenseManaged
   ```

   - If it returns True, the device is successfully onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
---

## ðŸ“Œ Once onboarded, the device will begin sending telemetry and alerts to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, visible under Device inventory.
