- On-premises Active Directory domain (e.g., `corp.aclab.tech`)
- Azure AD tenant linked to your domain (e.g., `corp.aclab.tech.onmicrosoft.com`)
- Azure AD Connect installed and configured
- BitLocker configured on all endpoints
  - Deployed via Intune or Group Policy
  - Recovery keys backed up to Azure AD or on-prem AD
- Windows Defender Antivirus and Firewall enabled by default
- Security features configured: Windows Hello, SmartScreen, Exploit Protection

## ‚úÖ Step 1 ‚Äì Hybrid Azure AD Join of On-Premises Devices

Enable domain-joined Windows devices to be automatically registered in Azure AD as **Hybrid Azure AD joined**, allowing for modern device management (Intune, Conditional Access, Defender, etc.).`

### A. Verify On-Prem Domain Join

1. Run the following command on client machines to verify the on-premises domain join status:

```powershell
whoami /fqdn
systeminfo | findstr /i "domain"
```

1. Open **Azure AD Connect** > Click **"Configure"**.
2. Choose **"Customize"**.
3. Select **Password Hash Synchronization**  
   ‚úÖ *Recommended for simplicity and security*.


### D. Sign In

1. Sign in with your **Azure AD Global Admin** credentials:  
   *(e.g., admin@corp.aclab.tech)*.


### E. Create a Sync Account

1. Create a sync account:  
   `corp.aclab.tech\syncadmin`

   - Temporarily add to **Domain Admins** and **Administrators** groups.
   - Remove privileges after setup.
   - Optionally place in a restricted group (e.g., **Azure-AD-Connect**).


### F. Link Directories

1. Link your directories:
   - Select **"Use Existing Account"** to connect to your on-premises AD forest.
   - Enter the sync account credentials.

2. Once directory validation is complete, click **Next**.


### G. Enable Password Writeback and Group Writeback

1. Enable **Password Writeback** and **Group Writeback**:
   - *Recommended to enable these features for hybrid identity management*.

üìÅ Recommended OU Structure:

```sql
corp.aclab.tech/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AzureAD-Groups/
```
![Groupe-writeback](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/03_AzureAD_Sync_%26_Endpoint_Security/Screenshots/Groups-Writeback.png)


### H. Enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for Seamless Login Experience

1. Enable **Single Sign-On (SSO)** for a seamless login experience.

   üí° *Only Domain Admin privileges are required for configuring SSO delegation*.

---

### I. Start the Installation and Synchronization Process

1. After reviewing the settings, click **Install** to begin synchronization.
2. Once complete, run the following PowerShell command to force a delta sync:

   ```powershell
   Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
   ```

### J. Configure Hybrid Azure AD Join (Windows + Azure AD Connect)
1. Launch AzureAD Connect (Entra Connect Sync) and select Configure Device Options.
2. Choose Configure Hybrid Microsoft Entra ID Join.

![Hybrid_Join](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/03_AzureAD_Sync_%26_Endpoint_Security/Screenshots/Hybrid_Join.png)

3. Add your domain (e.g., corp.aclab.tech) and sign in with a Global Administrator account.

4. Apply the configuration to enable automatic device registration in Azure AD.

### K. Configure Hybrid Azure AD Join with Auto Device Registration GPO

1. Open the **Group Policy Management Console** (`gpmc.msc`).

2. Locate and **edit your existing ‚ÄúAuto Device Registration‚Äù GPO** linked to the OU containing your target machines (e.g., `Devices`).

---

#### K.1 - Enable Automatic Device Registration

- Navigate to:  
  `Computer Configuration` ‚Üí `Administrative Templates` ‚Üí `Windows Components` ‚Üí `Device Registration`

- Double-click **Register domain-joined computers as devices** and set it to **Enabled**.
