## ‚úÖ Step 1 ‚Äì Hybrid Azure AD Join of On-Premises Devices

Enable domain-joined Windows devices to be automatically registered in Azure AD as **Hybrid Azure AD joined**, allowing for modern device management (Intune, Conditional Access, Defender, etc.).`

### A. Verify On-Prem Domain Join

1. Run the following command on client machines to verify the on-premises domain join status:

```powershell
whoami /fqdn
systeminfo | findstr /i "domain"
```

### B. Download and Install Azure AD Connect

1. **Download Azure AD Connect** from the official Microsoft website.
2. Launch the installer and proceed through the wizard.


### C. Azure AD Connect Configuration (Custom)
1. Open **Azure AD Connect** > Click **"Configure"**.
2. Choose **"Customize"**.
3. Select **Password Hash Synchronization**  
   ‚úÖ *Recommended for simplicity and security*.


### D. Sign In

1. Sign in with your **Azure AD Global Admin** credentials:  
   *(e.g., admin@corp.aclab.tech)*.


### E. Create a Sync Account

1. Create a sync account:  
   `corp.aclab.tech\syncadmin`

   - Temporarily add to **Domain Admins** and **Administrators** groups.
   - Remove privileges after setup.
   - Optionally place in a restricted group (e.g., **Azure-AD-Connect**).


### F. Link Directories

1. Link your directories:
   - Select **"Use Existing Account"** to connect to your on-premises AD forest.
   - Enter the sync account credentials.

2. Once directory validation is complete, click **Next**.


### G. Enable Password Writeback and Group Writeback

1. Enable **Password Writeback** and **Group Writeback**:
   - *Recommended to enable these features for hybrid identity management*.

üìÅ Recommended OU Structure:

```sql
corp.aclab.tech/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AzureAD-Groups/
```
![Groupe-writeback](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/03_AzureAD_Sync_%26_Endpoint_Security/Screenshots/Groups-Writeback.png)


### H. Enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for Seamless Login Experience

1. Enable **Single Sign-On (SSO)** for a seamless login experience.

   üí° *Only Domain Admin privileges are required for configuring SSO delegation*.

---

### I. Start the Installation and Synchronization Process

1. After reviewing the settings, click **Install** to begin synchronization.
2. Once complete, run the following PowerShell command to force a delta sync:

   ```powershell

### J. Configure Hybrid Azure AD Join (Windows + Azure AD Connect)
1. Launch AzureAD Connect (Entra Connect Sync) and select Configure Device Options.
2. Choose Configure Hybrid Microsoft Entra ID Join.

![Hybrid_Join](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/03_AzureAD_Sync_%26_Endpoint_Security/Screenshots/Hybrid_Join.png)

3. Add your domain (e.g., corp.aclab.tech) and sign in with a Global Administrator account.

4. Apply the configuration to enable automatic device registration in Azure AD.

### K. Configure Hybrid Azure AD Join with Auto Device Registration GPO

1. Open the **Group Policy Management Console** (`gpmc.msc`).

2. Locate and **edit your existing ‚ÄúAuto Device Registration‚Äù GPO** linked to the OU containing your target machines (e.g., `Devices`).

---

#### K.1 - Enable Automatic Device Registration

- Navigate to:  
  `Computer Configuration` ‚Üí `Administrative Templates` ‚Üí `Windows Components` ‚Üí `Device Registration`

- Double-click **Register domain-joined computers as devices** and set it to **Enabled**.

---

#### K.2 - Add Scheduled Task to Force Hybrid Azure AD Join

- Navigate to:  
  `Computer Configuration` ‚Üí `Preferences` ‚Üí `Control Panel Settings` ‚Üí **Scheduled Tasks**

- Right-click ‚Üí **New** ‚Üí **Scheduled Task (Windows Vista and later)**

- Configure the scheduled task as follows:

| Field                       | Value                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Name**                    | HybridAzureADJoin     |
| **Action**                  | Create                |
| **Run as user**             | SYSTEM                |
| **Trigger**                 | At startup            |
| **Program/script**          | `dsregcmd.exe`        |
| **Arguments**               | `/join`               |
| **Run with highest privileges** | Checked          |

---

#### K.3 - Apply and Validate

Apply the GPO and force an update on client devices:
```bash
gpupdate /force
```
6. Validate the device registration with the following command:
```bash
dsregcmd /status
```

![dsreg-Status](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/03_AzureAD_Sync_%26_Endpoint_Security/Screenshots/dsregcmd_status_emp01.png)

## L. Entra ID ‚Äì Device Verification

Once the Hybrid Azure AD Join configuration and device registration GPO are applied, you should verify that your domain-joined devices are correctly registered in Microsoft Entra ID.

### Important Note on Device Ownership

In the **Devices** list, the **Owner** field may display **None** for hybrid Azure AD joined devices. This is normal because:

- Hybrid joined devices are automatically registered without an explicit owner assigned.
- Assigning an owner manually is optional and not required for device management or compliance enforcement.

### How to Verify Device Registration

1. Access the [Microsoft Entra Admin Center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
2. Navigate to:  
Identity ‚Üí Devices ‚Üí All devices
3. Locate your devices and verify the following:
- **Join Type**: `Hybrid Azure AD joined`
- **Registered**: `Yes`
- **Owner**: May be `None` (expected)
- **Device Name**: Corresponds to the actual device hostname

![Entra Devices List](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/03_AzureAD_Sync_%26_Endpoint_Security/Screenshots/Entra-Devices.png)

This confirms your devices are successfully registered and managed via Microsoft Entra ID.

---

## üí° Next Steps

Now that your devices are successfully Hybrid Azure AD joined and synchronized with Microsoft Entra ID, you can centrally manage their configurations and security through **Microsoft Intune**. Intune enables you to deploy compliance policies, manage updates, and protect your endpoints effectively.

The next phase will guide you through enrolling devices in Intune and configuring endpoint security policies to ensure your environment remains secure and compliant.

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

- **Remove elevated privileges promptly:** Immediately remove the **sync account** from the Domain Admins and Administrators groups after Azure AD Connect setup is complete to reduce security risks.
- **Backup BitLocker recovery keys securely:** Ensure all BitLocker recovery keys are backed up either to Azure AD or your on-premises Active Directory to prevent data loss in case of device recovery scenarios.
- **Maintain backup and rollback plans:** Keep regular backups of your Azure AD Connect configuration and on-premises AD to quickly recover from any synchronization issues or misconfigurations.

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting Tips

If device synchronization or Hybrid Azure AD Join does not work as expected, consider these steps:

- **Check Event Viewer logs** on the Azure AD Connect server for errors related to sync or authentication.
- Use the **Azure AD Connect Health portal** to monitor synchronization status and alerts.
- Run the following command on client devices to check device registration status:

  ```powershell
  dsregcmd /status
