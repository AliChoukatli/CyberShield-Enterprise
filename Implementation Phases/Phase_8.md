- Open **Event Viewer** and search for Event ID 4624 (logon events).
  
    - ðŸ“¸ Screenshot: Event ID 4624 log showing user login activity.

### **Step 2: Analyze Event ID 4104 (PowerShell Activity)**
- Check for Event ID 4104 to review PowerShell script execution during the attack.
  
    - ðŸ“¸ Screenshot: Event ID 4104 log showing suspicious PowerShell script execution.

### **Step 3: Investigate Other Logs**
