Confirm that the target machine is reachable from the source (e.g., Helpdesk PC or Server):

```powershell
ping <ComputerName or IP>
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <Target> -Port 3389
```
### 2. **Check if Remote Desktop Enabled (on target machine)**
Ensure RDP is properly enabled:
```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" -Name "fDenyTSConnections" -Value 0
```
Enable required firewall rules:
```powershell
Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Remote Desktop"
Enable-NetFirewallRule -Name FPS-ICMP4-*
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow ICMPv4-In" protocol=icmpv4:8,any dir=in action=allow
