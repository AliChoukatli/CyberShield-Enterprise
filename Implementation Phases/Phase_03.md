# **Phase 3: Helpdesk & Network Troubleshooting**

## 🧰 Prerequisites

* Administrative rights on the local machine.
* PowerShell 5.1+ installed for running scripts.

## Overview

This phase covers common IT support tasks such as troubleshooting network issues and providing remote support using tools like TeamViewer and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Additionally, it includes the deployment of Office 365 using PowerShell scripts.

## 🛠️ Remote Support (RDP & TeamViewer)

### 🎯 Objective

Simulate IT Helpdesk remote support by connecting to another device using RDP and TeamViewer. This is a key support function in real-world environments for troubleshooting user issues remotely.

### 🔧 Steps

#### 🛁 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

1. On your main workstation, open the **Remote Desktop Connection** tool.
2. Enter the target computer's **hostname or IP address** (e.g., `ITClient01.corp.aclab.tech`).
3. Click **Connect**.
4. When prompted, enter **admin credentials** (domain user with RDP rights).
5. The remote session should open, giving you control of the target machine.

#### 💻 TeamViewer

1. Install and launch **TeamViewer** on both the support and target computers.
2. On the target computer, retrieve the **Partner ID** and **password**.
3. On your support machine, enter the **Partner ID**, then click **Connect**.
4. Enter the password when prompted to establish the remote session.

### 🖼️ Screenshots to Capture

* ✅ RDP session active (showing the remote desktop interface).
* ✅ TeamViewer connection window (showing the Partner ID screen or an active session).

### 🔐 Notes

* Ensure **Remote Desktop** is enabled on the target machine (`System Properties > Remote` tab).
* The user account must be in the **Remote Desktop Users** group or have local admin rights.
* TeamViewer requires internet access and both clients must be online for the session to work.

## 🔢 Step 1: Troubleshoot Network Connectivity

* **Ping Test:**

  * Open Command Prompt (CMD) and run:

    ```bash
    ping 192.168.2.1
    ```

  * Verify if the server responds.

  * If it does not, check the server’s network settings.

## 📂 Step 2: Use Device Manager for Network Issues

* Open **Device Manager** and check if the network adapter is functioning properly.
* Right-click the adapter and choose **Update driver** if necessary.

## 🚪 Step 3: Remote Support Using TeamViewer

* Install **TeamViewer** and use it to troubleshoot remote machines.

## 📊 Step 4: Troubleshoot Network with `ipconfig`

* Open CMD and run:

  ```bash
  ipconfig /all
  ```

  * Check for the correct IP address, subnet mask, and gateway.

  * 🖼️ Screenshot: `ipconfig` output showing network configuration.

## 🛠️ Step 5: Deploy Office 365 Using PowerShell

* Run the PowerShell script:

  ```powershell
  .\DeployOffice365.ps1
  ```

  * This will silently install Office 365 on the client machine.

## 🔹 Pro Tips

* Ensure that Remote Desktop is enabled and properly configured.
* Use `tracert` for more advanced network troubleshooting.
* Keep firewall settings in check to allow RDP and TeamViewer connections.
