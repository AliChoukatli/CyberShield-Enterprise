# 👥 Managing Users and Security Groups in Active Directory

## 📝 Introduction

In this section, you'll learn how to create and manage **user accounts** and **security groups** in Active Directory. These accounts represent employees within different departments (e.g., IT, HR, Sales) and will later be used for authentication, authorization, and Group Policy targeting.

You'll also explore PowerShell automation for bulk user creation, verify group memberships, and organize users into logical **Active Directory Security Groups** for streamlined permissions management.

## 🔴 **Creating Users in Active Directory**

- Open Server Manager > Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)

- Navigate to an OU (e.g., IT) > Right-click > New > User

### ⚙️ **PowerShell Automation (Optional):**

* [Add IT Users Script](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/IT_Support/PowerShell_Script/Add_IT_users.ps1)
* [Add Single User Script](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/IT_Support/PowerShell_Script/Add_user.ps1)

 ## 🔴 **Adding Users to Domain Users Group - Verification**
 *Ensure that the user is part of the `Domain Users` group for basic domain access permissions.*

If the user is not already a member of the **Domain Users** group, follow these steps:

1. **Open Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**

   Open **Server Manager > Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers**.

2. **Navigate to Users --> Domain Users Group**

3. **Check if the User is Already in the Group**

4. **Add the User to Domain Users**

   - Right-click on **Domain Users** > **Add**.
   - Select the user (e.g., **sophia.martinez**) to add to the group.
   - Click on **Add** and then **OK**.

This will add the user to the **Domain Users** group, ensuring they have the basic domain access permissions.

## 🔴 **Managing Groups and Permissions**

### 🔧 **Create AD Security Groups:**

1. Navigate to the `Groups` OU
2. [Right-click > **New** > **Group**

3. Create the following groups for each department:

   * `IT-Admins` (Security, Global)
   * `IT-Users` (Security, Global)
  
 ![All-Groups)](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/Screenshots/Phase%202/allgroups.png)
 
4. Right-click each group > **Properties** > **Members** > **Add** users from IT OU and for each departement

![Add-member](https://github.com/AliChoukatli/CyberShield-Enterprise/blob/main/Screenshots/Phase%202/add-member.png)

5. Now you should see all IT members

## ✅ Conclusion

By the end of this section:

- Users have been successfully created and placed in their corresponding **Organizational Units (OUs)**.
- Each user is a member of the **Domain Users** group to ensure basic access to domain resources.
- Department-specific **security groups** such as `IT-Admins` and `IT-Users` have been created and populated with the appropriate members.
- PowerShell scripts are available for bulk or individual user provisioning, enabling efficient, repeatable user onboarding processes.

This user and group structure is essential for applying **role-based access control (RBAC)**, managing file shares, applying GPOs, and preparing for future security configurations such as conditional access and endpoint protection.
