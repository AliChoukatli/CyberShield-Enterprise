# 📊 Microsoft Sentinel Setup and Architecture

## 🎯 Objective

Deploy Microsoft Sentinel in your Azure tenant to enable cloud-native SIEM and real-time threat detection.

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Azure Subscription with appropriate permissions
- Log Analytics Workspace (or permissions to create one)
- Azure AD Global Administrator or Security Admin
- Microsoft Defender data sources enabled (optional but recommended)

## 🏗️ Step 1 – Create a Log Analytics Workspace

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Search for **"Log Analytics Workspaces"** and click **Create**.
3. Choose:
   - **Subscription**: Your lab subscription
   - **Resource Group**: Create or reuse (e.g., `CyberShield-RG`)
   - **Workspace Name**: e.g., `CyberShield-Workspace`
   - **Region**: East US or your preferred
4. Click **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

📸 **Screenshot to take**: After creation, take a screenshot of the **workspace overview blade** showing the name, region, and Workspace ID.

## 🧠 Step 2 – Enable Microsoft Sentinel

1. In the Azure Portal, search for **"Microsoft Sentinel"**.
2. Click **+ Add** or **+ Create**.
3. Select the Log Analytics Workspace you created earlier.
4. Click **Add Microsoft Sentinel**.

📸 **Screenshot to take**: The Sentinel "Overview" page after enabling it on your workspace.

## 🔌 Step 3 – Understand the Architecture

Microsoft Sentinel is built on top of Azure Monitor and Log Analytics. Here’s how it fits into the broader security ecosystem:

```


📸 Optional: Take a screenshot of the Data Connectors tab in Sentinel.

📝 Notes
Sentinel is billed based on ingested data volume in the Log Analytics Workspace.

For lab use, enable 7-day free trial (Azure promotion).

Keep your resource region consistent (e.g., East US) for integration simplicity.
