# üõ°Ô∏è CyberShield Entreprise ‚Äì Securing a Small Business (25 Users)

This project simulates the end-to-end deployment of a secure, hybrid-cloud IT infrastructure for a fictional small business in the financial sector. It applies modern cybersecurity practices aligned with **Zero Trust**, **ISO/IEC 27001**, and **NIST CSF** using **Microsoft 365**, **Azure AD (Entra ID)**, **Intune**, **Microsoft Defender**, and **Microsoft Sentinel**.

> **Context:** Fictional SMB named *CyberShield Entreprise* handling sensitive financial data with a staff of 25. Prioritizing security, compliance, and remote device management.
