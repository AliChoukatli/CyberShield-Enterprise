# 🛡️ IT Support & Cybersecurity Project – Small Business Simulation (25 Users)

This project simulates the implementation of a secure, cloud-based IT environment for a fictional small business with 25 employees. It follows modern best practices including the Zero Trust model, ISO/IEC 27001, and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), using Microsoft 365, Azure AD (Entra ID), Intune, Microsoft Defender, and Sentinel.

---

## 🧱 Objectives

- Deploy a modern cloud IT infrastructure
- Apply cybersecurity best practices (Zero Trust, ISO/NIST)
- Manage identities, endpoints, and security operations
- Simulate a phishing attack and incident response workflow
- Automate common IT support tasks using PowerShell

## 🧪 Incident Response Simulation

**Use Case:** A user opens a phishing email → endpoint is compromised → alert is triggered

**Workflow:**

1. Defender detects a malicious file from phishing
2. Sentinel logs the alert and triggers high severity
3. Triage done using KQL and log review
4. Forensic evidence collected:
   - Windows Event Viewer (IDs: 4104, 4624, 4688)
   - Browser/USB artifacts (noted only)
5. User account disabled and isolated
6. Root cause summary noted in `Incident_Response/Phishing_Simulation_Steps.md`
