## ‚ú® Security Domains & Tools

This project highlights applied skills across critical security domains using Microsoft technologies:

- **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Implementation of Active Directory, Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID), Conditional Access policies, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

- **Endpoint Security:** Hardening and securing Windows 11 workstations and Windows Server 2022 using Microsoft Intune, BitLocker encryption, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and Group Policy Objects (GPO).

- **Security Operations (SecOps):** Centralized monitoring through Microsoft Sentinel, with custom detection logic using Kusto Query Language (KQL) and integration of key data connectors.

- **Cloud Security & Compliance:** Deployment of Zero Trust architecture principles, policy enforcement via Intune, and alignment with compliance standards such as **ISO 27001** and **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**.

- **Tooling & Automation:** Microsoft 365 Security Suite, Microsoft Defender XDR, PowerShell scripting, Microsoft Sentinel, and Intune for configuration, automation, and policy management.
