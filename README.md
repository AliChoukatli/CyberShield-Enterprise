## ‚úÖ Compliance Mapping

Our technical implementations directly contribute to meeting security and compliance requirements, aligning our operations with recognized frameworks such as ISO 27001 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

| Technical Implementation  | GRC Domain / Compliance Objective (ISO 27001 / NIST CSF)                         | Specific GRC Benefit                                          |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** | **ISO 27001 A.9.2.1** (User registration and deregistration)<br>**NIST PR.AC-7** (Privileged access) | Strengthens identity authentication, reducing risk of unauthorized access. |
| **Conditional Access**     | **ISO 27001 A.9.4.2** (Authentication of connections)<br>**NIST PR.AC-5** (Access management) | Ensures only compliant users and devices can access resources based on contextual risk. |
| **LAPS (Local Admin Password Solution)** | **ISO 27001 A.9.2.3** (Management of privileged access rights)<br>**NIST ID.AM-1** (Managed identities) | Secures and manages local admin accounts, preventing lateral movement. |
| **Endpoint Hardening**     | **ISO 27001 A.13.1.2** (Network service security)<br>**NIST PR.PT-3** (Network security) | Reduces attack surface on endpoints, limiting exploitable vulnerabilities. |
| **Sentinel (Logs & Rules)**| **ISO 27001 A.12.4.1** (Event logging)<br>**NIST DE.CM-4** (Data analysis) | Centralizes evidence collection and automates anomaly detection for auditing and response. |
