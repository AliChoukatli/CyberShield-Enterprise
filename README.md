## ‚úÖ Compliance Mapping

Our implementations directly support recognized cybersecurity frameworks like **ISO 27001** and **NIST CSF**.

| **Technical Implementation** | **GRC Domain / Compliance Objective** | **Specific GRC Benefit** |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| MFA                         | ISO 27001 A.9.2.1 / NIST PR.AC-7       | Reduces risk of unauthorized access. |
| Conditional Access          | ISO 27001 A.9.4.2 / NIST PR.AC-5       | Ensures contextual access control. |
| LAPS                        | ISO 27001 A.9.2.3
